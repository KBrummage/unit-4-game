A Star Wars RPG

Here is a game where the lineup of your opponents will decide if you make it through the gauntlet or not!

You pick a side, you pick a character, then you pick your first opponent.  Upon attack, your health and power of strike is dependent on your turn number and your opponents counterstrike.  

This project is my first attempt at grid!
